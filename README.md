# About

This repository contains code samples and projects for working with sensors and actuators.
Programs are written in `C` and use raspberry pi GPIO to interact with the sensors and actuators.

Each sensor or actuator is grouped in to a folder with resources for their data sheet, links to samples from other authors.

Larger project are build on top of above showcase. These real life project are using 1 or more sensors and actuators.
